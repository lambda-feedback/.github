# Welcome To Lambda Feedback!

Lambda Feedback is a platform for self-study that provides content, automated feedback and data analytics. The system is developed by Imperial College London and available at [lambdafeedback.com](https://www.lambdafeedback.com/). 

In this GitHub organisation we host code repositories for the following:

1.	[Evaluation functions](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/user-documentation/teacher/reference/evaluation_functions/) - microservices that generate automated feedback for use in Lambda Feedback or other compatible platforms. An evaluation function processes a student response and related context, and generates feedback. They can be written in any programming language and deployed on any infrastructure. Example languages include Python, Wolfram, and Lean. Our pinned repo includes the boilerplates to help start the development of your own evaluation function. 

2.	[Response Areas](https://lambda-feedback.github.io/user-documentation/teacher/reference/response_area_components/) – web components for students to input their response and receive feedback. Written in TypeScript. There is a Sandbox to support development of new response areas.
