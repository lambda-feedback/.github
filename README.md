# Welcome To Lambda Feedback!

Lambda Feedback is a self-learning online platform developed and hosted at Imperial, but available to all. Here you can find repositories related to how student receive feedback, enter their responses, and other miscellaneous functionality. 
Lambda Feedback uses two main parts to deliver automated formative feedback to students instantly. 

1.	Evaluation Functions – These are microservices that take a student’s response and the model solution as input, and validate and provide feedback on the answer. These can be written by anyone in any programming language, examples include Python, Wolfram Script, and Lean. Our pinned repo includes the boilerplates to help start the development of your own evaluation function. 
2.	Response Areas – These are the areas that students interact with, whether that be writing text, numbers, matrices or mathematical expressions. These are written in TypeScript, and we have developed a Sandbox to support your development of new response areas.
